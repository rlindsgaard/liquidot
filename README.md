# liquidot
A simple tool for generating dot files using liquid templating

## About

This is an attempt to bring some templating behaviour to the
DOT language as it has some drawbacks.

I like the syntax and structure of Jinja-templating but I found
it a little too overpowered. Liquid is more to my liking, and
that would allow me to learn a little bit of ruby as well.

This project is maintained and extended mainly for my own purposes,
I welcome pull requests or ideas.

## Installation

The tool is packaged as a ruby gem package and published at
https://rubygems.org/rlindsgaard/liquidot


## Usage
Stay tuned
